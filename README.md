# python-basics
This is my first GitHub repository where I’m learning and practicing **Python fundamentals**.
The goal of this repo is to understand core programming concepts through simple examples and hands-on coding.

## Files in this Repository
**loops.py**  
  Contains examples of `for` and `while` loops in Python.
 
## What I’m Learning
- Python syntax  
- Control flow (conditions & loops)  
- Writing and calling functions  
- Logical thinking and problem solving

## How to Run the Code
Make sure Python is installed on your system.
